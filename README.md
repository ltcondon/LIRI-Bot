# Summary

LIRI-Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI-Bot is a command line node app that takes in parameters ('spotify-this', 'movie-this', 'concert-this', and 'do-what-it-says'), and gives the user back data in the terminal.

## Technology

LIRI runs her one-person operation solely from her humble abode in the command line. Assisting LIRI are her good friends Inquirer, Axios, Dotenv, Sptify-Node-API, Moment.js, FileSystem, and two web API's - BandsInTown and the Online Movie Database (OMDB). 

Axios is used to make requests and retrieve responses for the web API's, Moment.js is used to convert the date and time of upcoming concerts to a prettier format, while FileSystem and Dotenv provide support behind the scenes.

## Current State

The generator is fully functional and displays correct and digestable information, but LIRI could definitely use a bit of a makeover. The goal is to at some point personalize LIRI's narrative with Inquirer,
